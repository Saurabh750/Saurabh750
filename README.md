- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Saurabh750
- ðŸ‘€ I have a strong interest in mathematics and in understanding how various machine learning algorithms function. Special Interests: ML, Deep Learning, NLP.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning many things: CUDA, trying to implement algorithms from scratch by reading research papers. End goal is to try to speed up these algorithms using CUDA.
- I have prior experience with Fine-tuning, RAG, Prompt engineering. Quite a bit experience with containerization too.
- ðŸ“« I am actively looking for (Research-focused) MLE, Data Scientist roles. How to reach me : Send a mail to saurabhpage1@gmail.com
- I am 24. Outside work, I love running and weight-training. Planning to run a HM ^^
