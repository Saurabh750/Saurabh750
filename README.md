- 👋 Hi, I’m @Saurabh750
- 🎯 I have strong interest in ML Systems. My goal is to design scalable, robust, high performing ML systems to solve real world problems.
- 👀 I’m actively looking for job opportunities at the intersection of ML and Systems.  
- 🌱 I've a mixed experience of NLP and Vision. I currently work as a ML Engineer where my work revolves around detecting events and generating insights from sports videos( Basketball majorly ) using Computer Vision. I've first-hand experience of the complete machine learning lifecycle starting from data annotation and model training to deployment and large-scale system integration. 
- 🧠 My NLP experience is mostly around finetuning of LLMs where I come up with a new variant of Muon named MuonAll for efficient finetuning of LLMs.
